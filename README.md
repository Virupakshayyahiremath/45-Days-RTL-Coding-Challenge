# 45 Days RTL Coding Challenge

This repository documents my **45-day RTL coding challenge**, focused on strengthening **RTL design fundamentals using Verilog** through consistent, hands-on implementation and verification.

The challenge progresses from **basic combinational logic to advanced RTL concepts**, following **industry-style coding and simulation practices**, with the goal of becoming **interview-ready for RTL / VLSI roles**.

## Structure
- `rtl/` – RTL design files  
- `tb/`  – Testbenches  
- `sim/` – Simulation artifacts  

## Tools
- Verilog / SystemVerilog  
- Xilinx Vivado
